# Documentation Hub

This folder is the canonical location for project documentation.

## Primary entry points
- `../README.md` — project overview
- `../QUICKSTART.md` — local setup and run flow
- `./runbooks/` — operational runbooks
- `./requirements/` — requirements and acceptance criteria
- `./test/` — testing references and plans
- `./iso27001/` — ISO27001 and security/compliance documentation
- `./agents/` — AI agent handoff and internal guides

## Documentation policy
- Keep living documentation under `docs/`.
- Avoid adding one-off reports in the repository root.
- Temporary analysis, generated logs, screenshots, and artifacts should stay local and ignored by git.
